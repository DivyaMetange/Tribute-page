<p>  
                ☛ Mother Terasa , (1910-1997) was a Roman catholic num who devoted her life to serving the poor and destitute around the world .<br><br>  
                ☛ In 1979, Mother Terasa was awardwd the Nobel Peace prize and become a symbol of charitable, selfless work.<br><br>  
                ☛ In 2016, Mother Teresa was canonised by the Roman Catholic Church as Saint Teresa<br><br>  
                ☛ This made it possible for her to extend the scope of her work.
                On October 7, 1950, Mother Teresa received permission from the Holy See to start her own order, “The Missionaries of Charity”, whose primary task was to love and care for those persons nobody was prepared to look after. In 1965 the Society became an International Religious Family by a decree of Pope Paul VI.
                <br><br> ☛ As the Missionaries of Charity grew under Mother's leadership, they expanded their ministry to other countries.
                <br><br> ☛By the 1970s she had become internationally well known as an advocate for the poor and helpless, due in part to a movie 
                <br><br> ☛ Mother Teresa received criticism over the years, especially in recent years as debate about abortion grew. 
                <br><br> ☛ Today the order comprises Active and Contemplative branches of Sisters and Brothers in many countries.
                <br><br> ☛The Society of Missionaries has spread all over the world, including the former Soviet Union and Eastern European countries. 
                <br><br> ☛ The order also has houses in North America, Europe and Australia, where they take care of the shut-ins, alcoholics, homeless, and AIDS sufferers.
                <br><br>   The Missionaries of Charity throughout the world are aided and assisted by Co-Workers who became an official International Association on March 29, 1969. By the 1990s there were over one million Co-Workers in more than 40 countries. Along with the Co-Workers, the lay Missionaries of Charity try to follow Mother Teresa’s spirit and charism in their families.
